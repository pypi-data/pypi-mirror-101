Format Python code (list of lists) as a fixed width table.

## Usage

You've got some tests or other code like this:
```python

def test_the_table():
    assert generate_the_table() == [
        ["Date", "Name", "Projects released"],
        ["2021-04-06", "spookylukey", 1],
    ]
```

Wouldn't it be nice if those columns lined up?

Copy the whole list of lists to the clipboard, then pipe to ``table-format
--guess-indent``. On Linux you could use `xsel` or `xclip` etc:

```shell
$ xsel | table-format --guess-indent
[
        ['Date',       'Name',        'Projects released'],
        ['2021-04-06', 'spookylukey', 1                  ],
    ]
```

The output should be ready to paste back into your editor.

### Options

Pass the `--help` flag to show all options:

```shell
$ table-format --help
```

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation

<!-- Uncomment this section after your first ``tox -e finish``
The most recent release can be installed from
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/table-format/) with:

```bash
$ pip install table-format
```
-->

The most recent code and data can be installed directly from GitHub with:

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/spookylukey/table-format.git
```

To install in development mode, use the following:

```bash
$ git clone git+https://github.com/spookylukey/table-format.git
$ cd table-format
$ pip install -e .
```
## Other tips

black: use `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` commands to stop black reformatting your
nicely aligned columns.


### Emacs
With default keybindings, doing `C-u` `M-|` `table-format --guess-indent` `ENTER` will
replace the current region with the formatted version from ``table-format`.

You can wrap it up in a nice function like this:

```elisp
(defun align-python-table ()
  (interactive)
  (shell-command-on-region
   ;; beginning and end of region
   (region-beginning)
   (region-end)
   ;; command and parameters
   "table-format --guess-indent"
   ;; output buffer
   (current-buffer)
   ;; replace?
   t
   ;; name of the error buffer
   "*Table-Format Error Buffer*"
   ;; show error buffer?
   t))
```

## üç™ Cookiecutter Acknowledgement

This package was created with
[@audreyfeldroy](https://github.com/audreyfeldroy)'s
[cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) package using
[@cthoyt](https://github.com/cthoyt)'s

template.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

The final section of the README is for if you want to get involved by making a code contribution.

### ‚ùì Testing

After cloning the repository and installing `tox` with `pip install tox`, the unit tests in the `tests/` folder can be
run reproducibly with:

```shell
$ tox
```

Additionally, these tests are automatically re-run with each commit in a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/spookylukey/table-format/actions?query=workflow%3ATests).

### üì¶ Making a Release

After installing the package in development mode and installing
`tox` with `pip install tox`, the commands for making a new release are contained within the `finish` environment
in `tox.ini`. Run the following from the shell:

```shell
$ tox -e finish
```

This script does the following:

1. Uses BumpVersion to switch the version number in the `setup.cfg` and
   `src/table-format/version.py` to not have the `-dev` suffix
2. Packages the code in both a tar archive and a wheel
3. Uploads to PyPI using `twine`. Be sure to have a `.pypirc` file configured to avoid the need for manual input at this
   step
4. Push to GitHub. You'll need to make a release going with the commit where the version was bumped.
5. Bump the version to the next patch. If you made big changes and want to bump the version by minor, you can
   use `tox -e bumpversion minor` after.
