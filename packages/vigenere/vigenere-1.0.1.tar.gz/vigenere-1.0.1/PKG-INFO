Description: # Vigenere Cipher
        The Vigenere cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers, 
        based on the letters of a keyword. It employs a form of polyalphabetic substitution.
        
        # Installation
        This library uses python3 which can be download from [here](https://www.python.org/). After installing python, use pip to install the package.
        ```
        $ pip install vigenere
        ```
        No external dependencies required in this version.
        
        # Quick Start
        Open the python shell and begin encrypting and decrypting texts with only 4 lines of commands.
        ```python
        >>> from vigenere import encrypt, decrypt, random_key
        >>> cipher_key:str = random_key() # one can even use user-defined key such as `qwerty`
        >>> cipher = encrypt('hello world', cipher_key) # with random_key function, cipher may vary everytime you run a program.
        >>> decrypt(cipher, cipher_key)
        'hello world'
        ```
        
        Read the documention of the library
        ```

        DESCRIPTION
            The Vigenere cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers,
        
                ...
        
            In the 19th century the scheme was misattributed to Blaise de Vigenere (1523-1596), and so acquired its present name.
