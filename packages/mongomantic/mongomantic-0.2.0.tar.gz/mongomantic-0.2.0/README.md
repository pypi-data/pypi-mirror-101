A lightweight MongoDB ORM based on Pydantic and PyMongo, heavily inspired by Mongoengine.

## API

```python
from mongomantic import BaseRepository, MongoDBModel


class User(MongoDBModel):
    first_name: str
    last_name: str

class UserRepository(BaseRepository):
    @property
    def _model(self):  # Define model type
        return User

    @property
    def _collection(self):  # Define collection name
        return "user"

user = User(first_name="John", last_name="Smith")
user_repo = UserRepository()

user = user_repo.save(user)
user.id  # ObjectId that was saved

```

## Your Opinion is Needed

Mongomantic can be kept as a simple wrapper around PyMongo, or developed into a miniature version of Mongoengine that's built on Pydantic.
The first direction would result in the following API:

```
# Direct pymongo wrapper
users = user_repo.find({"$and": [{"age": {"$gt": 12}}, {"name": "John"}]})

# But matches can be done as keyword arguments
john = user_repo.find(name="John")
```

On the other hand, a more complex version of Mongomantic could lead to:

```
# More Pythonic way of writing queries
users = user_repo.find(User.age > 12, name="John")

# Matches still compact
john = user_repo.find(name="John")
```

## ðŸš€ TODO

- [ ] Documentation
- [x] Basic API similar to mongoengine, without any queryset logic
- [x] Built on Pydantic models, no other schema required
- [x] BaseRepository responsible for all operations (instead of the model itself)
- [ ] ProductionRepository derived from BaseRepository with all errors handled
- [ ] Repository/model plugin framework (ex. SyncablePlugin, TimestampedPlugin, etc.)
- [ ] Wrapper for aggregation pipelines
- [x] Mongomock tests
- [ ] Flexible connect() function wrapper around PyMongo client (aliases, replica sets, retry writes, etc.)
- [ ] Clean up imports and expose essentials in main file
