# ACME Toolkit ![Docker](https://github.com/noahkw/acmetk/workflows/Docker/badge.svg?branch=master)

ACMEtk's main objective is the integration of Let's Encrypt-like services
into large decentralized networks by means of a centrally hosted service
that operates like a standard ACME CA on the client-facing side,
but relays ACME messages regarding certificate issuances to a
specified external CA.
