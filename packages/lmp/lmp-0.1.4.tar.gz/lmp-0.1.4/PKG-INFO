Description: Launch My Project is a simple CLI that allows its users to quickly start projects via the smp CLI. A single function call can begin all processes and development tools needed to start working on a project. This includes starting up an IDE, a command prompt at the projects path, run scripts, open websites, open a file explorer at the projects path, and much more. Start My Project is in a very early stage, but its basic functionality will simplify every developers life.
