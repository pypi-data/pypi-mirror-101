# Deep Q Learning Framework

Simple Deep Q Learning framework. This is just a slightly modified version of
[DeepMind Acme](https://github.com/deepmind/acme)'s implementation of a deep Q network,
with a few extra utilities. You can install it with `pip` by using the following command:

``
$ pip install qdeep
``
