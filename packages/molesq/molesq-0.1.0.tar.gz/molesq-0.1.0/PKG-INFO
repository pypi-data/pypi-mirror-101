Description: # MoLeSq
        
        Pronounced like "mollusc".
        
        A python implementation of the Moving Least Squares algorithm
        for transforming sets of points from one space to another,
        as published in [Schaefer et al. (2006)][1].

        ## Usage
        
        Control points and points of interest are given as numpy arrays.
        
        ```python
        from molesq import Transformer
        
        tran = Transformer(my_control_points, my_deformed_control_points)
        deformed = tran.transform(my_points_of_interest)
        
        undeformed = tran.transform(deformed, inverse=True)
        
        ```
