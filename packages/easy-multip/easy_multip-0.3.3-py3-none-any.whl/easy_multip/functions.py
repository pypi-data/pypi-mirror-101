    Equivalent usage to the map() function for use with expensive
    functions operating on iterable.

    Runs these operations in parallel on the max number of processes for the job,
    and maintains the same resulting index order as a normal map() or
    list comprehension usage.

    NOTE: This implementation appears FASTER than normal multiprocessing.Pool.map()!
          The reason is likely because the jobs are distributed as evenly as possible
          among the processes whereas in normal map, one process might get all of the
          remaining jobs if the job count is not cleanly divisible by processor count.

          (Example, for 100 jobs on 8 processors has each processor running 12 or 13 jobs
          instead of 7 doing 12 jobs and one doing 16 jobs.)
