Description: This is the GitHub for the Python module OwOpy! This module OwOifies your sentence better than any other. Available in both synchronous (normal) form and asynchronous (async/await syntax) form.
        By "OwOifies your sentence" I mean it turns your sentence into japanese "furry" baby babblespeak :>
        
        It has 2 functions - owoify('example_string') and aio_owoify('example_string'). The aio_owoify must be used in async form to prevent errors.
        
        If you do not know the difference between sync and async, it is recommended to use the normal owoify() (synced function) as it is the most basic and is used for most programs and applications.
        
        Note that python 3.6 or above is required due to the use of F-strings in the source code.
        
        Enjoy using it ðŸ’»
