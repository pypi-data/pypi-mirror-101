"""Detect a UTF-8-capable locale for running child processes in.

Sometimes it is useful for a program to be able to run a child process and
more or less depend on its output being valid UTF-8. This can usually be
accomplished by setting one or more environment variables, but there is
the question of what to set them to - what UTF-8-capable locale is present
on this particular system? This is where the `utf8_locale` module comes in.

    """Get a locale name that may hopefully be used for UTF-8 output.

    The `detect_utf8_locale()` function runs the external `locale` command to
    obtain a list of the supported locale names, and then picks a suitable one
    to use so that programs are more likely to output valid UTF-8 characters
    and language-neutral messages. It prefers the `C` base locale, but if
    neither `C.UTF-8` nor `C.utf8` is available, it will fall back to a list of
    other locale names that are likely to be present on the system.

    The `utf8_locale` package has a predefined list of preferred languages.
    If a program has different preferences, e.g. only expecting to parse
    messages written in English, the `detect_utf8_locale()` function may be
    passed a `languages` parameter - an iterable of strings - containing
    the language names in the preferred order. Note that `languages` should
    only contain the language name (e.g. "en") and not a territory name
    (e.g. "en_US"); locale names for the same language and different
    territories are considered equivalent. Thus, the abovementioned program
    that expects to parse messages in English may do:
