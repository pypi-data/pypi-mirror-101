Description: # <img src="irisreader.png" width="100" height="100"/> &nbsp; IRISreader #
        
        The __IRISreader__ library provides functionality to read IRIS level 2 data
        by the [IRIS satellite](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/iris/index.html) and to process it for big data applications. 
        IRISreader works best with a Jupyter notebook.
        
        If you came here to look for something that provides a good python
        replacement for IDL code and is well-integrated into SunPy, have a look at
        [IRISpy](https://github.com/sunpy/irispy).
        
        __Warning__:
        
        IRISreader is under constant development and a stable version cannot always be guaranteed. Documentation is available but might not reflect the newest
