        ## Code Samples
        
        ### Get public user data from a MeaxisNetwork User
        
        ```python
        from meaxisnetwork import users
        
        Meaxis = users.User(platform = "username", query = "Meaxis")
        
        # JSON of the User Object
        
        print(Meaxis.UserJSON)
        
        
        # Any attribute of the user object will be a variable to use.
        
        print(Meaxis.username + Meaxis.id + Meaxis.description)
        
        ```
        
        ### Get all Shop Items in the MeaxisNetwork Shop
        ```python
        from meaxisnetwork import shop
        
        Shop = shop.Shop()
        print(Shop.items)    
        ```    
                                                                                                                
        
        ## Installation
        
        Go to the following link:  
        ```
        https://pypi.org/project/meaxisnetwork
        ```
        
        And then copy the installation link. 
        
        ### Windows
        
        In the search bar, type in 'Command Prompt' and then press 'Yes' to the User Account Control Prompt.   
        
        Then paste the command you copied and press enter.
        
        ### Linux
        
        Run the following command in your terminal:
        ```
        python3 -m pip install meaxisnetwork
        ```
        
        If it says anything about python3 not being found, you need to install python with your Package Manger.

        ```
        sudo apt-get install python
        ```

        ```
        sudo pacman -S python
        ```
          
          
        For other distributions, use your package manager to install python.
