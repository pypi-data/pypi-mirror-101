# KeePass command application

[KPCLibPy][1] is a KeePass command application written in Python.

The original [KeePass][3] by Dominik Reichl is a .NET application written in C#. `KeePassLib` is part of KeePass which can be built as a library to support the major functions of KeePass. However, at the moment, `KeePassLib` is still built for .NET framework which can run on Windows only. I modified `KeePassLib` and extended it as a .NET Standard library - [KPCLib][2]. [KPCLib][2] stands for KeePass Portable Class Library at the time when I started the work. Portable Class Library (PCL) is replaced by .NET Standard Library nowaday.

[KPCLibPy][1] is just a Python wrapper of [KPCLib][2] using [Python.NET][4]. In this perspective, `KPCLibPy` is fully compatiable to the original KeePass, since the majority of code is  the same as KeePass.

In order to save the development effort and have a nice user interface, the Python library [python-nubia][5] from Facebook is used as the framework to support command line interface.

## Key Features
- Full compatible with the original KeePass
- .NET Standard 2.0 support with [KPCLib][2]
- Cross platform support with .NET Standard and .NET core
- Nice user interface with [python-nubia][5]
- Interactive mode that offers fish-style auto-completion
