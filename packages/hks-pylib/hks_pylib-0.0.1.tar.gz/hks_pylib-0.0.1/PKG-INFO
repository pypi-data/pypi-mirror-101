Description: # hks_lib
        This is huykingsofm's python library, including:
        - `logger`: A module is used to print notifications to console screen or write logs to file. It is special because you can disable the print/write statement by modifying few parameters without having to delete or comment them. 
        - `cipher`: A very simple crypto module bases on [cryptography](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/). It is easier to use than original one.
        - `done`: A module defines a class (`Done`) for returning complexity values easier.
        - `http`: A module is used to read and generate raw http packets.
        
        # How to build
        We are assuming that your code is running on the Python 3.7.1. If you meet any problems, even if with other versions, let [create an issue](https://github.com/huykingsofm/hks_pylib/issues) to notify our. We will solve them as quick as possible.  
        
        ## Create Virtual Enviroment (optional but IMPORTANT)
        *If you had your own virtual enviroment, you can ignore this step.*  
        You should create a virtual enviroment to avoid conflicting with other applications on your machine when installing our module. The virtual enviroment should be installed with [Python 3.7.1](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-371/) (you can use other Python versions but we can't ensure that unexpected errors will not appear suddenly).  
        I highly recommend you to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) because its utilities. The command of creating virtual enviroment in Anaconda is:
        ```bash
        $ conda create -n your_venv_name python=3.7.1
        $ conda activate your_venv_name
        (your_venv_name) $ _ 
        ```
        
        Or use `Python venv`:
        ```bash
        $ python -m venv path/to/your/venv
        $ path/to/your/venv/Scripts/activate.bat
        (your_venv_name) $ _
        ```
        
        ## Method 1: Install the most stable version
        ```bash
        (your_venv_name) $ pip install hks_pylib
        ```
        
        ## Method 2: Install the newest version
        
        ```bash
        (your_venv_name) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
        (your_venv_name) $ pip install -e .
        ```
        
        # How to use
        Just use `import` statement and enjoy it. We will write documentations and tutorials as soon as possible so that you can understand our library easier.
        
        ```python
        from hks_pylib.done import Done  # A Done object can be used to substitute complexity return value
        
        from hks_pylib.logger import StandardLogger  # A class is used to print/write logs console/file
        from hks_pylib.logger import StandardLoggerGenerator  # A class is used to generate StandardLogger objects. You should use this class instead of using StandardLogger directly
        
        from hks_pylib.cipher import NoCipher, AES_CBC, SimpleSSL  # Some common ciphers
        
        from hks_pylib.http import HTTPReader, HTTPWriter  # You can create or read raw http packets with these class
        ```
