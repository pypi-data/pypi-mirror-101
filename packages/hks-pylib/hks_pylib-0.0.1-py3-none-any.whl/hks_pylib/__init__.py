"""
This is huykingsofm's python library, including:
- `logger`: A module is used to print notifications to console screen or write logs to file. It is special because you can disable the print/write statement by modifying few parameters without having to delete or comment them. 
- `cipher`: A very simple crypto module bases on [cryptography](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/). It is easier to use than original one.
- `done`: A module defines a class (`Done`) for returning complexity values easier.
- `http`: A module is used to read and generate raw http packets.
