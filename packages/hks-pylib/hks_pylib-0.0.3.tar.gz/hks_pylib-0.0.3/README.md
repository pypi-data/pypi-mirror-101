# hks_pylib
This is a Python 3 utility library of [huykingsofm](https://github.com/huykingsofm). It has some modules, including:
- `logger`: A module is used to print notifications to the console screen or write logs to file. It is special because you can disable the print/write statement by modifying few parameters without having to delete or comment them manually. 
- `cipher`: A very simple crypto module based on [cryptography](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/). It is easier to use than the original one.
- `done`: A module defines a class (`Done`) for returning complex values more conveniently.
- `http`: A module is used to parse or generate raw http packets.

# How to build
Our library is only supported by Python 3. Now we test it only on Python 3.7.1. If you meet any problems, even if with other versions, you could [create an issue](https://github.com/huykingsofm/hks_pylib/issues) to notify us. We will solve them as quickly as possible.  

## Create Virtual Environment (optional but IMPORTANT)
*If you had your virtual environment, you can ignore this step.* 

You ought to create a virtual environment to avoid conflicting with other applications on your machine when installing our module. The virtual environment must be installed with [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads).  
I highly recommend you to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) because of its utilities. The command of creating a virtual environment in Anaconda is:
```bash
$ conda create -n your_venv_name
$ conda activate your_venv_name
(your_venv_name) $ _ 
```

Or use `Python venv`:
```bash
$ python -m venv path/to/your/venv
$ path/to/your/venv/Scripts/activate.bat
(your_venv_name) $ _
```

## Method 1: Install the PyPI version (not completed yet)
```bash
(your_venv_name) $ pip install hks_pylib
```

## Method 2: Install the newest version (recommendation)

```bash

(your_venv_name) $ git clone https://github.com/huykingsofm/hks_pylib.git
(your_venv_name) $ cd hks_pylib
(your_venv_name) hks_pylib $ pip install -e .
```

# How to use
Just use `import` statement and enjoy it. We will write documentation and tutorials as soon as possible so that you can understand our library easier.

```python
# A Done object can be used to substitute 
# complex return values
from hks_pylib.done import Done

# A class is used to print/write 
# logs to console/file
from hks_pylib.logger import StandardLogger  

# A class is used to generate StandardLogger objects.
# You should use this class instead of 
# using StandardLogger directly
from hks_pylib.logger import StandardLoggerGenerator  

# Some common ciphers
from hks_pylib.cipher import NoCipher, AES_CBC, SimpleSSL 

# You can parse or generate raw http packets with these class
from hks_pylib.http import HTTPParser, HTTPGenerator  
```
