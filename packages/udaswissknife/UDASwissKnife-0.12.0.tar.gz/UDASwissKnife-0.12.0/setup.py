Welcome to `SwissKnife`, a set of tools and functionalities built by the Data Engineering team at [@uDATech](https://twitter.com/uDAtech).\n\nThis library is born from an urge of having a common repo to gather some functions that are widely used accross our tools.\n\nSuggestions and contributions are more than welcome, always respecting our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n## Installation guide\n\nThis repo is available to download via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/UDASwissKnife/) and it has different sets of functionalities that can be independently installed:\n\n- **Basic** set:\n  + Packages included:\n    + `info`\n  ```bash\n  pip install UDASwissKnife\n  ```\n\n- **Extended** set:\n  + Packages included:\n    + `avro`\n    + `gcloud`\n  ```bash\n  pip install UDASwissKnife[avro,gcloud]\n  ```\n\n- **Complete** set:\n  + Includes both _Basic_ and _Extended_ sets\n  ```bash\n  pip install UDASwissKnife[all]\n  ```\n\n## Using the modules\n\n### `info`\nThe main goal of this module is to identify the environment in which we are currently working. This is done thanks to an environment variable `$ENV` which contains the name of the working environment. The accepted case insensitive values of this working environment are:\n\nThe object `SwissKnife.info.CURRENT_ENVIRONMENT`, which is of type `ExecutionEnvironment`, an enum that contains the following entries:\n\n- `PRO`\n- `PRE`\n- `TEST`\n- `DEV` (default)\n\nThen, it's possible to know the working environment using a set of methods which return a boolean indicating whether we are in that environment or not:\n\n- `is_pro()`\n- `is_pre()`\n- `is_test()`\n- `is_dev()`\n\nIt's also possible to obtain the working environment using object `SwissKnife.info.CURRENT_ENVIRONMENT`.\n\n## Why is there a Dockerfile?\n\nThe one and only purpose of the `Dockerfile` is to execute the tests defined in the project. By building and running the Docker image, tests results will be printed in the terminal. If it's needed to save the result in a file, run:\n\n```bash\nsudo docker run swissknife:latest > nosetests.xml\n```",
