Description: # ds_example_plugin
        
        A plugin for [`data_slicer`'s](https://github.com/kuadrat/data-slicer) PIT 
        that simply serves as an example for how to make such a plugin.
        
        It only adds minimal functionality to PIT, namely the function `blur` which
        applies a Gaussian filter to the displayed data and the function 
        `example_function` which just prints out a message to PIT's ipython console.  
        As such, it really is not particularly useful beyond illustrative purposes.
        
        Refer to the [documentation of `data_slicer`]() for more information.
