# Anime Character API

An unofficial API to get data about anime characters, anime news and more.
The API scrapes [myanimelist](https://myanimelist.net/) to get data about anime characters and anime news.

Currently, the API is very basic, but I will be adding a lot of stuff to easily extract data.

If you wish to see a feature, please raise an [issue](https://github.com/DriftAsimov/animec). We will surely work on it.
You can also join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/x3qAZV3) to get regular updates about the API.

To install the library:
