# _sailsim_ - A sail boat simulator
This is a simulation program that is meant to test sailing algorithms.

This project is developed by Tillman Keller & Michael Behrens. We are just starting up.

## Installation
This package is not yet downloadable with `pip`. You can still use pip to install it by using the following command:

`pip install .`

To install the package for development add the `-e` option:

`pip install -e .`

## Usage
In `tests/basictest.py` is an example use of the module.

## Documentation
The class diagram can be fond in the `docs` folder. The folder contains a class diagram that displays the structure of the project. Additionally, a sequence diagram explains how the simulation of in step is working.

## Contributing
The program is still in its pre-alpha state, so contributions are not that easy yet. When the software reaches its alpha state we welcome all suggestions and bugs.
