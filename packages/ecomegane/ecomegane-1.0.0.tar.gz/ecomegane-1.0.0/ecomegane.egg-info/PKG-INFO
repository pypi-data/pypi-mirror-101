Description: # Eco-Megane Python Client
        
        ## About
        
        The Eco-Megane online platform provides monitoring data for photovoltaic systems.
        However, they do not offer an API or any convenient way of programmatically accessing the data. This client allows you to download certain data from the site using Python.
        
        ## Installation
        
        To install the client using `pip`:
        
        ```
        pip install ecomegane
        ```
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        To begin downloading data, you will need to find your power plant's ID number on the Eco Megane site.

        ## Example Usage
        
        For a complete sample, see `docs/sample.py`.
        
        **Downloading hourly data**
        
        ```python
        import datetime
        from ecomegane import EcoMeganeClient
        
        site_id = '00031234567'
        today = datetime.date.today()
        
        with EcoMeganeClient('username', 'password') as client:
            kwh = client.get_hourly_kwh(site_id, today)
            for timestamp, energy in kwh.items():
                print(timestamp, energy)
        ```
        
        
        **Downloading daily data**
        
        ```python
        import datetime
        from ecomegane import EcoMeganeClient
        
        site_id = '00031234567'
        today = datetime.date.today()
        
        with EcoMeganeClient('username', 'password') as client:
            # Download daily data for the current month.
            kwh = client.get_daily_kwh(site_id, today)
            for timestamp, energy in kwh.items():
                print(timestamp, energy)
        ```
