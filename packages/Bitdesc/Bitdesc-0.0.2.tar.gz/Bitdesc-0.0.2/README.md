# BiT

BiT is a novel approach capable of quantifying a complex system of diverse patterns through 
species diversity and richness, and taxonomic distinctiveness. 
It considers an image as a species ecosystem and computes species diversity and richness measures, 
and taxonomic indices to describe the texture. 
BiT takes advantage of ecological patterns' invariance characteristics to build a permutation, rotation, and translation invariant descriptor. 
Experiments on different datasets have shown that BiT texture descriptor has advantages over several texture descriptors and deep methods.
