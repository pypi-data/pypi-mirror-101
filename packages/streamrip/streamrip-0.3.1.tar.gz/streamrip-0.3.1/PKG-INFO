Description: # streamrip
        
        A scriptable stream downloader for Qobuz, Tidal, Deezer and SoundCloud.
        
        ## Features
        
        - Downloads tracks, albums, playlists, discographies, and labels from Qobuz, Tidal, Deezer, and SoundCloud
        
        - Automatically converts files to a preferred format
        - Has a database that stores the downloaded tracks' IDs so that repeats are avoided
        - Easy to customize with the config file
        
        ## Installation
        
        First, ensure [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) is installed. Then run the following in the command line:
        
        
        
        macOS/Linux:
        
        ```bash
        pip3 install streamrip simple-term-menu --upgrade
        ```
        
        Windows:
        
        ```bash
        pip3 install streamrip windows-curses --upgrade
        ```
        
        
        
        If you would like to use `streamrip`'s conversion capabilities, or download music from SoundCloud, install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
        
        ## Example Usage
        
        **For Tidal and Qobuz, you NEED a premium subscription.**
        
        Download an album from Qobuz
        
        ```bash
        rip -u https://open.qobuz.com/album/0060253780968
        ```
        
        ![Streamrip downloading an album](https://github.com/nathom/streamrip/blob/main/demo/download_url.png?raw=true)
        
        Download the album and convert it to `mp3`
        
        ```bash
        rip --convert mp3 -u https://open.qobuz.com/album/0060253780968
        ```
        
        
        
        To set the quality, use the `--quality` option to `0, 1, 2, 3, 4`:
        
        | Quality ID | Audio Quality         | Available Sources                            |
        | ---------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
        | 0          | 128 kbps MP3 or AAC   | Deezer, Tidal, SoundCloud (most of the time) |
        | 1          | 320 kbps MP3 or AAC   | Deezer, Tidal, Qobuz, SoundCloud (rarely)    |
        | 2          | 16 bit, 44.1 kHz (CD) | Deezer, Tidal, Qobuz, SoundCloud (rarely)    |
        | 3          | 24 bit, ≤ 96 kHz      | Tidal (MQA), Qobuz, SoundCloud (rarely)      |
        | 4          | 24 bit, ≤ 192 kHz     | Qobuz                                        |
        
        
        
        
        
        ```bash
        rip --quality 3 https://tidal.com/browse/album/147569387
        ```
        
        Search for albums matching `lil uzi vert` on SoundCloud
        
        ```bash
        rip search -s soundcloud 'lil uzi vert'
        ```
        
        ![streamrip interactive search](https://github.com/nathom/streamrip/blob/main/demo/interactive_search.png?raw=true)
        
        Search for *Rumours* on Tidal, download it, convert it to `ALAC`
        
        ```bash
        rip -c alac search 'fleetwood mac rumours'
        ```
        
        Qobuz discographies can be filtered using the `filter` subcommand
        
        ```bash
        rip filter --repeats --features 'https://open.qobuz.com/artist/22195'
        ```
        
        
        
        Want to find some new music? Use the `discover` command (only on Qobuz)
        
        ```bash
        rip discover --list 'best-sellers'
        ```
        
        > Avaiable options for `--list`:
        >
        > - most-streamed
        > - recent-releases
        > - best-sellers
        > - press-awards
        > - ideal-discography
        > - editor-picks
        > - most-featured
        > - qobuzissims
        > - new-releases
        > - new-releases-full
        > - harmonia-mundi
        > - universal-classic
        > - universal-jazz
        > - universal-jeunesse
        > - universal-chanson
        
        
        
        ## Troubleshooting
        
        First, consult the help pages and their example commands.
        
        ```bash
        rip --help
        ```
        
        ```bash
        rip filter --help
        ```
        
        ```bash
        rip search --help
        ```
        
        ```bash
        rip discover --help
        ```
        
        ```bash
        rip config --help
        ```
        
        Second, try resetting the config file with `rip config —reset`. Config errors often arise after an update where a new feature was added.
        
        
        
        If that doesn't work, open an issue on GitHub. Please include the traceback and the command you used.
