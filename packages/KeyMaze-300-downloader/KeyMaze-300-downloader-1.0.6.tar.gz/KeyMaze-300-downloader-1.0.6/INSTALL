Still a quick and dirty thing, but you'll need pyserial and pygtk (if you want a gui). Just install it as usual from python (maybe the unique way under Windows), or from your distribution package manager (recommanded under Linux OS)
You'll need the pl-2302 kernel module, but I still have to check this !
