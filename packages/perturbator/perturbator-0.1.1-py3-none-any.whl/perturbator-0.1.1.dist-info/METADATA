## Run commands in batches
Add commands in a text format in any text file and execute to trigger multiple steps in one go

### Sample Command:
`poetry run perturbator execute-from-file --command-file ~/Desktop/commands.txt`

### Format of commands in file:

```
insert 'task' to process in file '~/Desktop/input1.bpmn' at flow 'flow11' and output in '~/Desktop/output.bpmn'
delete element with id 'task11' from process in file '~/Desktop/output.bpmn' and output in '~/Desktop/output.bpmn'


serial insert process from '~/Desktop/input2.bpmn' to process in file '~/Desktop/output.bpmn' at flow 'flow12' and output in '~/Desktop/output.bpmn'
conditionally insert process from '~/Desktop/input2.bpmn' to process in file '~/Desktop/input1.bpmn' between 'flow11' and 'flow13' and output in '~/Desktop/output.bpmn'
parallel insert process from '~/Desktop/input2.bpmn' to process in file '~/Desktop/input1.bpmn' between 'flow11' and 'flow13' and output in '~/Desktop/output.bpmn'
delete process fragment from process in file '~/Desktop/input1.bpmn' between 'flow11' and 'flow13' and output in '~/Desktop/output.bpmn'
```
