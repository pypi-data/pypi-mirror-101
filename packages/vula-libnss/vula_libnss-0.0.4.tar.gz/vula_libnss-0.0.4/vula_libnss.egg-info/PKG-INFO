Description: This project provides a source package and also an architecture specific libnss
        shared object file which are suitable for upload to pypi. We encourage users to
        build a deb and it will put the required libnss shared object into
        `/lib/libnss_vula.so.2`; users of the pip installed `vula_libnss` need to copy
        the `libnss_vula.so.2` into the correct place and reconfigure `nsswitch.conf`
        to use this new module.
        
        If in doubt, build a Debian package and install it; if you're an advanced user,
        you may pip install `vula_libnss` and manually configure it for use with
        `vula`.
        
        To build a Debian package:
        
        ```make deb```
        
        For developers, we also provide some additional build targets.
        
        To build a python source package and an arch specific wheel for the current
        system architecture suitable for upload to pypi:
        
        ```make pypi-build```
        
        To upload those files to pypi:
        
        ```make pypi-upload```
        
        To clean up after the build:
        
        ```make clean```
