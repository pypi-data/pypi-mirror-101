        pip install excel-submission-brokerr  

## Developer Notes

### Publish to PyPI

1. Create PyPI Account through the [registration page](https://pypi.org/account/register/).
    
   Take note that PyPI requires email addresses to be verified before publishing.
   
3. Add a `setup.py` configuration file containing the name and version of the project.

3. Package the project for distribution.
 
        python setup.py sdist
        
    Take note that `setup.py` is configured to build a distribution with name `excel-submission-broker`.
    Currently, this PyPI project is owned privately and may require access rights to change. 
    Alternatively, the project name in `setup.py` can be changed so that it can be built and
    uploaded to a different PyPI entry.
    
4. Install [Twine](https://pypi.org/project/twine/)

        pip install twine        
    
5. Upload the distribution package to PyPI. 

        twine upload dist/*
        
    Running `python setup.py sdist` will create a package in the `dist` directory of the project
    base directory. Specific packages can be chosen if preferred instead of the wildcard `*`:
    
        twine upload dist/excel-submission-broker-0.1.0.tar
