Description: # pyhumour
        
        This is a module for the characterization and quantification of concise humour using 10 distinct computational features.
        These features were inspired by [Ritchie's Incongruity-Resolution Theory](https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/3397), and are formulated as follows:
        1. Obviousness (`obviousness`)
        2. Compatibility (`compatibility`)
        3. Inappropriateness (`inappropriateness`)
        4. Humorous Conflict (`humorous_conflict`)
        5. Non-humorous Conflict (`non_humorous_conflict`)
        6. Adjective Absurdity (`adjective_absurdity`)
        7. Humorous Noun Absurdity (`humorous_noun_absurdity`)
        8. Non-humorous Noun Absurdity (`non_humorous_noun_absurdity`)
        9. HMM Probability (`hmm_probability`)
        10. N-Gram Probability (`ngram_probability`)
        
        
        ## Example
        ```python
        import pyhumour
        a = pyhumour.PyHumour([<humorous_corpus>], [<non_humorous_corpus>])
        a.fit()
        a.obviousness('this is an obvious statement')
        ```
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        Run the following to install:
        ```python
        pip install pyhumour
        ```
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        
        ## Developing pyhumour
        
        To install pyhumour, along with the tools you need to develop and run tests, run the following in your virtualenv:
        ```bash
        pip install -e .[dev]
        ```
        
        
        ## Distributing pyhumour
        
        ```python
        python setup.py bdist_wheel
        ```
        
        ```python
        python setup.py sdist
        ```
        
        
        ## Pushing pyhumour (to pypi)
        
        ```bash
        pip install twine
        ```
        
        ```python
        twine upload dist/*
        ```
        
        ### Pushing to testpypi
        
        ```python
        twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
        ```
        
        
        ## Testing in different distributions of python
        
        ```bash
        pip install tox
        ```
        
        ```python
        tox
        ```
        ## Unit tests developed with unittest
        
        ### Running Unit Tests
        Use the following command inside of git root directory to run the unit tests:
        ```python
        nosetests -w ./ --with-coverage --cover-html --cover-package=./ --cover-erase --with-timer --timer-top-n 10
        ```
        A folder called `cover` will be created in `src` post running the
        command. You can open `cover/index.html` to view the lines (if any)
        that need to be additionally covered in the unit tests.
