Description: # AnimeHoursFinder
        Find the amount of hours you took to watch the anime you love.  
        
        Uses [unoffical mal api by Daren Liang](https://github.com/darenliang/mal-api) to get the data from [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/).  
        
        #### Install  
        `pip install animeHours==0.1.1`  
        
        ### Usage   
        To import the package do this  
        ```
        from animeHours import animeHours as ah
        ```  
        
        To search with an XML file exported from MyAnimeList create a `Finder` class with the `file` arg pointing to the file  
        ```
        file = "anime-list.xml"
        finder = ah.Finder(file=file)
        
        hours = brain.find("open")
        print("You've watched {} hours of anime\n".format(hours)
        ```  
          
        To search with a string of anime titles, create a `Finder` class with the `animelist` arg pointing to the string

        animeList = "Dr Stone, My Hero Academia Season 1"
        brain = ah.Finder(animelist=animeList)
        
        hours = brain.find()
        print("You've watched {} hours of anime\n".format(hours))
