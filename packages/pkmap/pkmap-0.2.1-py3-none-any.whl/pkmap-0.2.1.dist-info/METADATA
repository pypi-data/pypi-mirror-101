# the Pseudo Karnaugh Map

## Introduction

The Pseudo Karnaugh Map (PKMap),
a coloured Weighted / Multi-valued Karnaugh Map,
an Enchanced Karnaugh Map as the project's initially named,
is an evaluation method to visualize the imbalanced class distribution
of a dataset.

This project was started to guide the generating of synthesis datasets
in which a self-collected data is added into a public dataset.
Later, we found it works in dataset imbalance representation as well.

## Why PKMap

Gain instructive insight of a datset before utilizing
is currently virtually impossible.
The PKMap is expected to offer an intuitionistic and visualized recognization
of the imbalanced classes distribution of a dataset.

A primiary [paper](https://www.e3s-conferences.org/articles/e3sconf/pdf/2021/12/e3sconf_icersd2020_04006.pdf)
about the PKMap has been publish, more is on the way.
