"""
Curated list of examples.

Examples in this list represent good practices and are tested in the CI
integration, so we have a decent guarantee that they are always kept in a
working state.

The code probably use more asserts than what is advisable in production code,
but this makes them more effective test cases. We try to document the asserts
in a "narration" style.
