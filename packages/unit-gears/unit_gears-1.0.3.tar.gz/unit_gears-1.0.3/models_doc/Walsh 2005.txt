Walsh and Hiscock 2005 - experimental pot vs gillnet for cod fishing
extensive CPUE reporting

pThe number of cod captured per hour of soak time per pot type
was used to calculate the CPUE + 1. Zero plus one factor is used in statistical analysis to allow
data to be adjusted to eliminate zero values, which can skew data. This CPUE (number of fish
per hour + 1) was Log10 transformed for the analysis of variance (ANOVA). This would
rationalize data providing more accurate values of significance.
