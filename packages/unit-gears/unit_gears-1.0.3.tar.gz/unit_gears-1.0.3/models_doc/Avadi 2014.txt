LCA of Peruvian Anchoveta fleet

What have we got here?
 - net composition (Supplementary materials):
   64% nylon
   21% PE
   14% lead
   1% copper + steel
   
 - from table 2:
    gear use per t landings: 84.74 g new net construction per t landings
    gear maint per t landings: 762 g net maintenance per t landings
    gear EOL per t landings: 542 g nylon
    gear EOL per t landings: 122 g lead

 - from table 3:
    fuel use per landed tonne, which can equate to kwh per landed tonne if we knew how engine power ratings are specified
    * observed constancy of this parameter across vessel sizes! pretty close to 15 kg fuel per tonne (min. 14.52 max 16.64) for all categories with n>4 records
    = so we relate fuel use to engine power through fuel heating value and engine efficiency, as appropriate, and that gives us a catch per kwh data point!

 - from table 6: a metastudy of 6-10 other studies, all with fuel usage per t reported! this gives us a single source solution for estimating capture rating for purse seiners.

It doesn't help with turning engine power into gear-- though the other studies might. We simply have no kw*h rating anywhere.

But we don't need that- we already have it because we have unit gear losses from catch through to gear!

 Figure 3 gives a good report of holding capacity to catch: catch / (number of vessels * holding capacity ) = catch per vessel m3. but that's not helpful. let's just leave it.

Let's track down some of his other references and see what we find....
but for now this is solid

same authors, largely same data but also include small-scale vessels

Use Avadi et al in Capture folder-- it has the summary data for nylon-- although the reported values for industrial don't match

Of course, a problem with the fuel usage estimate is that presumably that is not talking about fuel usage during fishing, but total vessel fuel use.

hmm. all the ind-ecol papers are reporting fuel usage per tonne. that may not actually be giving us capture rates.

ok. let's move to something else.
