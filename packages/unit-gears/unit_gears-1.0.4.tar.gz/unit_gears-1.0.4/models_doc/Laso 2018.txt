European anchovy purse seine

T1 we have total landings of 196 / 0.435 tonnes or 420-odd tonnes +- 103

scope was 1 year of activity
FU was 1 kg landed catch

I don't understand why Table 1 lists <500 tonnes when Fig1 showes ~7000 tonnes
but that's neither here nor there

The point is table 2+3:
1 kg European Anchovy
 5.17 g  Nylon in construction
 2.33 g  Nylon in maint
 7.5  g  EOL

plus 3.085 EVA, split along the same ratio
0.661 g "polysteel"

11.245 g / kg = kg / t
SD = 

dissipation being 25% of total?

45% of the mass was brought in at maintenance, so that is the dissipative fraction
45/145 or 31%

I'm supposed to do 6 of these?
I don't think that paper's going to happen




Total lifecycle plastics were 49.39 g in Table 3

lifespan 5 years
25% annual replacement
ok, boom.
