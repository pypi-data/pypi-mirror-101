It's a pretty small trawl: HL 13.7m
moreover it appears to be cotton, not nylon (!)
4-panel trawl OTB4

From our research we determined that the vessel was 19.8m and had apparently 680 kW power rating (which seems high)
twin 450 hp engines * 750w/hp = sure about 340 kw.

As Camila observed, the data seem to report COUNT of fish, not weight.
let's look to fishbase to see if we can get typical weight of chesapeake bay croaker and white perch
fishbase lists a maximum reported weight of 2.6kg, max length of 55 cm
but nothing typical

And white perch-- 58.0cm / 2.7kg max l/w

Google reports an uncomplicated 3.1 lb (1.4kg) for atlantic croaker and 2.7 lbs (1.2kg) for white perch.

well anyway, for 28 croaker trawls we get an average of 560 +-302 units = 784 +- 422 kg per 20 min trawl = 2.3 t/h ==> 291 kwh/t
and Watanabe is 8500 kwh/t??

These are highly-efficient trawls. but that is actually in the middle of the pack in GFW.

Trawls were "standardized to 20 min" but a few had distinctly shorter durations. leaving those out we get 588 +- 288
not much different

for perch avg 484.2 +- 228 * 1.2 kg/fish x3 = 1750 kg / h ==> 388 kwh/t


Those are usable.

Let's try applying the Notti model to characterize the trawl weight--
our headline is 13.7m and square width which is much shorter than any cohort reported in Sala et al 2019... the smallest being 25.44m
in fact, it's smaller than the smallest headline reported in Notti 2013 (minimum 21m)

How can we estimate the weight of gear from this dimension?

I mean, from our affine relationship it's nearly 0. This is just a very tiny trawl. 30-50kg?
What is the minimum TrW reported?

EU Rpt Table 10:
OTB2
Minimum HL 12.30m;
minimum FL 17.80;
minimum TrW 7.94

OTB4
minimum HL  18.60m;
minimum FL  25.58m;
minimum TrW 21.88
