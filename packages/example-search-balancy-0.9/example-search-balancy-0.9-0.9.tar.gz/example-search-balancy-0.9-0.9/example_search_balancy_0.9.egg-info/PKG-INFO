Description: # Search
        
        Script's main functionality is searching for a keyword or a phrase via bing.com or duckduckgo.com search engines.
        
        It allows choosing search engine, number of results, saving format, possibility to search urls recursively.
        
        ### How to install locally
        
        Python3 and Pip3 should be already installed. 
        
        Installation is made by command:
        ```bash
        pip install search
        ```
        
        ## How to use
        
        The usual way to use search is follow:
        
        ```python
        from search import search
        search(keyword="python")
        ```
        
        Complete list of script arguments :
        
        `keyword` - is a word, or a phrase to search. Default value is 'python'.
        
        `engine` is the search engine to use for search (bing, duckduckgo). Default value is 'bing'. 
        
        `number` is the number of searched urls of 1st rang. Default value is 3.
        
        `number2` is the number of recursively searched urls of 2nd rang. Default value is 2.
        
        `format` is saving format (csv, json, console). Default value is 'json'.  
        
        `recursively` if is True, then script will use recursive searching.  
        
        Example of using `search` with arguments:
        ```python
        search(engine="bing", number=2, number2=3, recursively=True, keyword="javascript", format="console")
        ```
        In this case it will search for a phrase "javascript" via bing search engine and will print into console
        8 found urls (2 urls of 1st rang and 2*3 urls of 2nd rang)
