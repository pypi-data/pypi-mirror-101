Description: # Vex-Cog-Utils
        
        Utility functions for the Vex-Cogs repo.
        
        There is nothing stopping you from using this in your own cogs, however some of the stuff here is geared towards my cogs. I would recommend you pin the version.
        Example of pinned install in info.json: ``git+https://github.com/Vexed01/vex-cog-utils.git@v1.0.0``
        
        Docstrings fully document each function.
        
        ## Versioning
        
        ``major.minor.micro``
        
        Major and minor releases are likely to include breaking changes. There will be nothing breaking in micro releases.
        
        ## Changelog
        
        I will endeavour to keep a basic changelog in the ``CHANGELOG.md`` file.
        
        ## Contributing
        
        If you want to open a PR, go ahead! I don't really see much need as this is geared towards my cogs but I will probably accept it.
        
        This repo as some tests in tox and a checks workflow.
        
        ## PyPi
        
        I have no intentions to publish this on PyPi in the near future. If I do, the likely reasoning would be to do it as a learning experience.
