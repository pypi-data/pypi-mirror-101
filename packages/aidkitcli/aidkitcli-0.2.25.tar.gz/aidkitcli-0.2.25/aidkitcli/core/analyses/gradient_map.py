    Create a RequestModel to visualize which inputs affect the model's
    prediction the most in a plot that shows the development of the

    When the task addressed by the model is regression, the gradient is
    computed using the predicted value. In case of a classification model,
    the gradient is calculated using the value of the output neuron of
    the class with the highest score.
