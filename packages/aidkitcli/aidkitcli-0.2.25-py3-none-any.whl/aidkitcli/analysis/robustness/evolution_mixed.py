    Execute a blackbox attack using an evolutionary strategy that creates a
    perturbation per eligible data point in each file of the data set and
    returns a plot showing the performance of the model on the clean and
    the perturbed data.

    The perturbation is crafted to make the model classify the data point
    as the category given by target_category while minimizing the perturbation
    size. More specifically, the algorithm tries to keep the sum over the
    coordinates of the distance between the respective coordinate
    of the perturbed and the original data point small. If the nth feature
    is qualitative, the distance between the nth coordinate of a point x
    and a point x' is

    * 0 if x'[n] == x[n]
    * distance_weights[n] if x'[n] != x[n]

    Conversely, if the nth feature in quantitative, the distance between the
    nth coordinate of a point x and a point x' is calculated as

    distance_weights[n] * abs(x'[n] - x[n])

    The algorithm finds the point using an evolution strategy, automatically
    adapting the variance in each coordinate.

    Currently, this attack strategy can be applied to classification models.
    The data set may consist of both quantitative and qualitative
    variables.

                             and the number of categories for categorical
