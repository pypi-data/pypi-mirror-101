Description: ========
        mpi list
        ========
        
        This package implements the `DFM` class.
        
        The `DFM` is a useful abstraction for working with
        lists distributed over a set of MPI ranks.
        The acronym stands for distributed free monoid,
        which is just a fancy way to say it's a list.
        
        If you're familiar with spark, it's like an RDD,
        but only holds a list.
        
        Quick Start
        ===========
        
        .. code-block::
        
            from mpi_list import Context, DFM
        
            C = Context() # calls MPI_Init via mpi4py
        
            # After each of the three lines below:
            #  1. each rank now has 1000//C.procs consecutive numbers
            #  2. each rank now has a list of strings
            #  3. only numbers containing a '2' remain
            dfm = C . iterates(1000) \
                    . map(lambda i: f"String {i}") \
                    . filter(lambda s: '2' in s)
        
            if C.rank == 0:
                # Caution! Uncommenting this will deadlock your program.
                # Collective calls must be called by all ranks!
                #print( dfm . head(10) )
                pass
        
            # This is OK, since all ranks now have 'ans'
            ans = dfm.head(10)
            if C.rank == 0:
                print( ans )
        
            ans = dfm . filter(lambda s: len(s) <= len("String nn")) \
                      . collect()
            if ans is not None: # only rank 0 gets "collect"
                print( ans )
        
        Launch your program with `mpirun python my_prog.py`.
        
        If you're using a supercomputer, consider installing
        `spindle <https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/spindle/software>`_,
        and then use `spindle mpirun python my_prog.py`.
