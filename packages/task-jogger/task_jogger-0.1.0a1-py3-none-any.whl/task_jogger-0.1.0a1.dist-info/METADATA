task-jogger
===========

More affectionately known as ``jogger``.

``jogger`` is a simple Python-based command line tool that isn't quite a fully-fledged task *runner*. In addition to supporting arbitrary tasks, run either directly on the command line or as Python scripts, it ships with some common, useful, Django-aware tasks that can adapt their behaviour based on which packages are available in the system.
