Description: =================
        publicdata_census
        =================
        
        
        This library defines a set of `Application Urls
        <https://github.com/CivicKnowledge/appurl>`_ and `Row Generators
        <https://github.com/CivicKnowledge/rowgenerators>`_ that allow access to public
        datasets. For instance, using the Census Reporter URLs, you can define access
        to a American Community Survey data table on the Census Reporter website. Then,
        using the associated Row Generator, you can download the data as a sequences of
        rows.
        
        For instance, this code will return rows from ACS table B17001 for tracts in San Diego County
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from publicdata import  parse_app_url
        
            url = parse_app_url("census://CA/140/B17001")
        
            # Or: url = CensusReporterUrl(table='B17001',summarylevel='140',geoid='CA')
        
            for row in url.generator:
                print(row)
        
        
        The library uses the appurl and rowgenerator python entrypoints, so all
        libraries that you install that use the entrypoints can be accessed via the
        ``parse_app_url`` and ``get_generator`` functions.
