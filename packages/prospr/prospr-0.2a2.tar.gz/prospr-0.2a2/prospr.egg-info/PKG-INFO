        **Creator:** Okke van Eck
        
        This project is a universal toolbox for protein structure prediction within the HP-model.
        It will contain a datastructure for creating own algorithms, pre-created algorithms, datasets and visualization functions.
        Besides folding proteins, this package will also make it possible to determine the relative hardness of a protein for an algorithm.
        This allows for a fair comparison across the different algorithms.
        
        So far, only square lattices are supported in n-dimensions.
        The amino acids can only be placed in the corners of the squares and have to be one unit away from the previously placed amino acid.
        
        ## Installation guide
        This package can simply be installed via pip by running:
        ```bash
        pip install prospr
        ```
        
        ## Archives
        All the C++ core files and datasets are also available as compressed archives.
        See the subsections below for direct links.
        
        ### C++ core
        All the core code which prospr runs on, is available as a compressed archive.
        The folder `archives` contains a [.zip](archives/prospr_core.zip) and
        a [.tar.gz](archives/prospr_core.tar.gz) archive.
        
        ### Datasets
        The complete collection of datasets is available as a compressed archive in the
        `archives` folder. It is available as a [.zip](archives/prospr_data.zip) and a
        [.tar.tz](archives/prospr_data.tar.gz) archive.
        
        ## Example usage
        *Work in progress*
        
        ## Future work
        This toolbox could be used for other protein folding problems within discrete models.
        It would be a great extension to support different models by creating a modular amino acid.
