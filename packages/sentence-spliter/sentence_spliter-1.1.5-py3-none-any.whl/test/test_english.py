They had the school badge on their chests. The security guards at the door and the small white-collar workers in the same office building were all dumbfounded. No one had ever seen such a big scene. In a place like shanghai, the brand of fudan university was so loud that it was easy for thieves to make use of it. The two vice presidents were dressed in suits and had elegant demeanors. Such a group of people stood in the lobby waiting for the elevator and immediately attracted everyone's attention. Within a few minutes, the news spread throughout the zhongjin building, causing a huge sensation. Rumor has it that the newly opened star technology on the 16th floor has a mysterious background and has a very special relationship with fudan university. Many business leaders in the same building secretly decided to find an opportunity to visit. How did luo jia know about this? He was busy greeting the two presidents and the top students of fu dan. The zhongjin building is a high-end office building. It is very famous in the Xujiahui area. Its decoration and layout are all first-class. Within the building, there are several branches of the yangtze river delta of the world's top 500 enterprises. The surrounding traffic is convenient and business is developed. It is a typical place where every inch of land is gold. Luo jianeng opened the company here, which was enough to prove her strength. The students of fu dan were very excited to be able to work and study here for a period of time. What made them even more excited was the company's treatment. Just entered the door, each person is a $ 5,000 opening red packet, although it is now the era of mobile payment, luo jia took out cash. It was also money. The money in the phone looked like a cold string of numbers. Cash, on the other hand, was different. It was full of envelopes, thick stacks, and each one of them was a brand new grandpa with big red hair. It was heavy in his pocket, and there was a strong sense of satisfaction. Ren Zhengfei said that if you give enough money, you will become a talent if you are not a talent. Luo jia is not a stingy person in this regard. This is the 21st century, what is the most expensive? Talent! In luo jia's eyes, these students with the school badges on them were little golden men who could walk. Those who wanted to make a lot of money for themselves in the future would not be able to do so unless they were raised fat. The tea room was filled with all kinds of drinks, including red bull, nestle, little ming, and snacks such as chocolate, pistachios, and biscuits. As a traditional item in the internet industry, there were also many instant noodles. At the end of april, watermelons and strawberries were so expensive that luo jia asked the fruit store to bring two large baskets full of them. As a technical manager, li molan was busy introducing luo jia. Not to mention, at least 12 team leaders, luo jia, wanted to meet. Di wuchang and Hong Tao, who had been following luo jia these days, were also one of the team leaders.\" Sure, your company is very good."
