# ðŸ“ˆ Panel HighCharts

THIS IS APLHA SOFTWARE. I BELIEVE THINGS WORK, BUT THE PACKAGE NEEDS TO BE USED TO TELL. AND USAGE MIGHT ALSO CHANGE THE API. DOES CURRENTLY ONLY WORK IN JUPYTER LAB AND PANEL APP - NOT JUPYTER NOTEBOOK!

The `panel-highcharts` package makes it easy to use [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/) from Python for exploratory analysis in a Jupyter Notebook or as a [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org) Web App.
