# &#128200; Panel HighCharts

The `panel-highcharts` package makes it easy to use [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/) from Python for exploratory analysis in a Jupyter Notebook or as a [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org) Web App.

- Add more examples
- Add badges for 100% test coverage etc.
- Distribute as conda package

- 20210404: Can now display in Classic Notebook
- 20210403: First Release to PyPi. Works in Jupyter Lab and Panel App.
