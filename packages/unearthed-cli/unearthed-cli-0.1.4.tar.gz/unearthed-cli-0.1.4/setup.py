You must be logged in to run other commands.\n\n## `unearthed new`\n\nThis command asks the user which challenge they wish to download and unpack the model template for. The template will be unpacked in a named folder inside the current directory. A custom path can be specified with `unearthed new /path/to/dir/`\n\n## `unearthed submit`\n\nThis will bundle the source code in a Docker container and then submit the code to the submission pipeline. The user is provided a link to the submission tracker, which will auto-popup in their browser, so they can track the progress and logs of their submission.\n\nYou can disable the tracker from opening in the browser by specifying `unearthed submit --no-tracker`\n\n## `unearthed tracker`\n\nWill open the tracker for the last submission that was made.\n\n## `unearthed preprocess`\n\nThis command will run the preprocess code in a Docker container similar to how it will execute in the submission pipeline. It can be used to validate the preprocessing code is working before submitting.\n\n### `unearthed train`\n\nThis command will train a model, including calling the preprocessing code, in a Docker container similar to how it will execute in the submission pipeline. It can be used to validate the training code is working before submitting.\n\n### `unearthed predict`\n\nThis command will simulate generating predictions on the public dataset so that the predictions can be inspected locally before submitting.\n\n### `unearhted score`\n\nThis command will run the scoring function to generate a score against the public dataset. It can be used to check the score against the public dataset before submitting.\n',
