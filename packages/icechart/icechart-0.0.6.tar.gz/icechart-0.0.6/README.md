## Installation

### Pip 
The easiest way to install icechart is using pip

```
pip install icechart

## Features


Icechart is a python library developed to simplify the querying, acquisition and analysis of major satellite altimetry data (such as icesat-2, cryosat-2) towards facilitating scientific discovery and insights into the ice and snow covered regions. In its full development, the package will provide the following features:

- Convert spatial data format between shapefile to GeoJSON
- Display Earth Engine data layers for interactive mapping.
- Support Earth Engine JavaScript API-styled functions in Python, such as Map.addLayer(), Map.setCenter(), Map.centerObject(), Map.setOptions().
- Retrieve satellite altimetry data around user defined ROI from NSIDC platform
- Add the data to interactive map
- Plot and analyze the data

## Submit a Feedback
The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/Surfix/icechart/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:
- Explain in detail how it would work.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
- Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome :)
