Description: ==================
        openapi_elm_client
        ==================
        
        `openapi-elm-client` generates Elm client code from OpenAPI 2.0 specification.
        
        Usage
        =====
        Basic usage is like this::
        
            openapi-elm-client my_spec.yaml Some.Module.Name
        
        This will read the OpenAPI spec from `my_spec.yaml` and create an Elm module named `Some.Module.Name`. This writes the
        output to stdout, so a more typical invocation might be::
        
        
            openapi-elm-client my_spec.yaml Some.Module.Name > src/Some/Module/Name.elm
        
        Generated code
        ==============
        
        `openapi-elm-client` produces a named type alias for each definition in the input spec. It also produces a function for
        calling each endpoint defined in the spec, along with appropriate JSON encoders and decoders.
        
        Tests
        =====
        
        You can run the tests by first installing the test dependencies::
        
            pip install ".[test]"
        
        and then invoking pytest::
        
            pytest tests
        
        Approval tests
        --------------
        
        `openapi-elm-client` uses `godkjenn <https://bitbucket.org/sixty-north/godkjenn/src/master/>`_ for approval testing. We
        have collection of input specs along with "approved" versions of the code generated by `openapi-elm-client`; if the
        generated code ever changes, we have to see if it's still correct.
