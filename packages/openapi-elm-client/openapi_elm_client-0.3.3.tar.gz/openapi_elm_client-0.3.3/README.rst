==================
openapi_elm_client
==================

`openapi-elm-client` generates Elm client code from OpenAPI 2.0 specification.

Usage
=====
Basic usage is like this::

    openapi-elm-client my_spec.yaml Some.Module.Name

This will read the OpenAPI spec from `my_spec.yaml` and create an Elm module named `Some.Module.Name`. This writes the
output to stdout, so a more typical invocation might be::


    openapi-elm-client my_spec.yaml Some.Module.Name > src/Some/Module/Name.elm

Generated code
==============

`openapi-elm-client` produces a named type alias for each definition in the input spec. It also produces a function for
calling each endpoint defined in the spec, along with appropriate JSON encoders and decoders.

Tests
=====

You can run the tests by first installing the test dependencies::

    pip install ".[test]"

and then invoking pytest::

    pytest tests

Approval tests
--------------

`openapi-elm-client` uses `godkjenn <https://bitbucket.org/sixty-north/godkjenn/src/master/>`_ for approval testing. We
have collection of input specs along with "approved" versions of the code generated by `openapi-elm-client`; if the
generated code ever changes, we have to see if it's still correct.
