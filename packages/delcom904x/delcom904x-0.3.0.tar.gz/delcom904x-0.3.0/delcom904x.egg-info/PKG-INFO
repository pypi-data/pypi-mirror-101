Description: delcom904x
        ==========
        delcom904x is a python class and command-line script to control the [Delcom Products 904x
        series multi-color visual signal indicators](http://www.delcomproducts.com/products_USBLMP.asp).
        These are USB HID devices that are easily controllable from most platforms.
        
        It has been tested with the [904005-SB](http://www.delcomproducts.com/productdetails.asp?productnum=904005-SB)
        but should work with any of the other models without any issues. The yellow in the green,
        red and *yellow* indicators is wired the same as blue. There also doesn't appear to be a
        method of detecting if the attached indicator supports blue or yellow, so blue and yellow
        commands are synonyms.

        udev Notes
        ----------
        
        On Linux machines, the default udev rulesets may set the permissions on the device to only
        be accessible to the root user. Add the following rule to `/etc/udev/rules.d/` and
        re-plugin the indicator to allow all users to access the device (optionally, consider
        changing `MODE="0666"` to `GROUP="dialout"` to allow only the dialout group access).
        
                SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0fc5", ATTRS{idProduct}=="b080", MODE="0666"
