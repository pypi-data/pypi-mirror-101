        ===========
        
        A library to interface with the Valve Index® Base Stations (also commonly referred to as 'Lighthouse V2') through BLE.  
        This lib mostly exists because homeasstant requires all code directly interfacing with hardware to be done through a seperate lib, but it can be used just fine as a standalone lib.
        
        Features
        ===========
        
        - Scan for nearby base stations.
        - Power stations on/off
        - Read power state
        - Identify (make LED flash)
        
        Description
        ===========
        
        I will write a more extensive API doc when I have my homeassistant stuff going.
