CLSP short for **C**ommand **L**ine **S**election **P**rompt, is a minimalistic and fast to navigate single choice interface.

```python
from clsp import select


user_choice = select([1, 2, 3], info="Please pick a number:")

print("You selected:")
print(user_choice)
```

It's designed to be user-friendly, minimal, and very easy to understand.

Due to its search function, it supports large lists and spares the end-user unnecessary frustration.

Whether you want the user to choose a file, number, country code, you name it. It will fulfill its purpose.


## Documentation


```python
# CLSP can be easily imported by using:
from clsp import select

# You can then show the actual prompt by calling the select function while passing a list type as the argument.

user_choice = select(["Choose me!", "Dare you choose me!"])

# You can navigate using the arrow key up and the arrow key down + enter to confirm your selection.
```

You can provide additional key arguments for further configuration:
