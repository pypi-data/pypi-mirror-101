# Introduction 

This project defines the implementation of the Python API for Orchid*.

(*Orchid in a mark of Revel Energy Services. Inc.)

Specifically, the `orchid` package exposes the Orchid API to Python applications and to the Python REPL.

# Getting Started

## Create a virtual environment

# Examples

Additionally, this project installs four examples in the `examples` directory of the `orchid-python-api`
package:

- `plot_trajectories.ipynb`
- `plot_monitor_curves.ipynb`
- `plot_treatment.ipynb`
- `completion_analysis.ipynb`

The first three notebooks plot:

- The well trajectories for a project
- The monitor curves for a project
- The treatment curves (pressure, slurry rate and concentration) for a specific stage of a well in a project
 
Additionally, the notebook, `completion_analysis.ipynb`, provides a more detailed analysis of the completion
performed on two different wells in a project.
 
To use these examples: 

- You may need to 
  [configure the Orchid Python API to find the Orchid installation](#configure-the-orchid-python-api)
- You **must** 
  [configure the Orchid Python API to find the Orchid training data](#configure-the-orchid-training-data)
- You may need to [view the Orchid API configuration details](#view-orchid-configuration-details)
- You may want to invoke the command, `copy_orchid_examples`

    This command copies the example files into an optionally specified (virtual environment) directory. (The 
    default destination is your current working directory.) Note that this command is a command-line script 
    that runs in a console or terminal. Additionally, this command supports a help flag (`-h` / `--help`) to 
    provide you with help on running this command.

## End-user preparation

We recommend the use of virtual environments to use the Orchid Python API. This choice avoids putting 
Orchid-specific packages in your system Python environment.

You have several options to create and manage virtual environments: `venv`, `pipenv`, `poetry`, and `conda`.
The `venv ` is available as a standard Python package and is a spartan tool to manage environments. `poetry`
is a tool targeting developers but can be used by end-users. Our recommended tool is `pipenv`. It provides a 
good balance between `venv ` and `poetry`. Remember, both `pipenv` and `poetry` must be installed in your 
Python environment separately from Python itself, but can be installed using `pip`. Finally, 
[conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)

> is an open source package management system and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS
> and Linux. Conda quickly installs, runs and updates packages and their dependencies. Conda easily creates,
> saves, loads and switches between environments on your local computer. It was created for Python programs,
> but it can package and distribute software for any language.

Although we currently recommend `pipenv`, because we believe many of our users use `conda` (either
Anaconda or Miniconda), we have a [section](#step-by-step-conda-install) for installing the 
`orchid-python-api` in a `conda` virtual environment.

Using any of `pipenv`, `venv` or `poetry`, your first step is to create a directory for *your* project. Then, 
change into *your* project directory.

We recommend the use of `pipenv`. This environment hides a number of details involved in managing a virtualenv
and yet provides a fairly simple interface. We will assume in this document that you are using `pipenv`.

# Step-by-step install

- Install python 3.8 by following [these instructions](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html). To 
  ensure access from the command line, be sure to select the "Add Python 3.x to PATH" option on the
  [installer start page](https://docs.python.org/3/_images/win_installer.png). 
- Open a console using either `powershell` or the Windows console.
- Create a directory for the virtual environment. We will symbolically call it `/path/to/orchid-virtualenv`.
- Change the current working directory by executing, `chdir /path/to/orchid-virtualenv`.
- Create an empty virtual environment by running `pipenv install`.
- Activate the virtual environment by running `pipenv shell`
- Install Orchid by running `pip install orchid-python-api`.

# Step-by-step conda install

- Install [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) or
  [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) following the corresponding instructions for
  your operating system. 
- If installing on Windows, the installer will present 
  [this screen](https://docs.anaconda.com/_images/win-install-options.png). We have seen no need to install 
  Anaconda / Miniconda on your [PATH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)). Although we do not
  disagree with option to register the Anaconda / Miniconda version of Python as your default Python
  executable, in some situations, accepting this choice can cause problems. 
- Since we will be using **both** `conda install` and `pip install` to install packages, read the article, 
  [Using Pip in a Conda Environment](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/using-pip-in-a-conda-environment). Our 
  subsequent instructions assume you have read this article and have chosen how you wish to manage these
  two package installers together. 
  
The following instructions assume that you will use the simple (put perhaps not scalable) process of creating
the `conda ` virtual environment with all packages you want to use available in the Anaconda/Miniconda
ecosystem and, within that virtual environment, use `pip` to install `orchid-python-api`.

- Open an Anaconda Powershell console.
- Optionally create a directory for your work.
    - We symbolically call it `/path/to/orchid-virtualenv`.
    - Change to the current working directory by executing `chdir /path/to/orchid-virtualenv`.
- Create an empty virtual environment by running `conda create --name <your-virtualenv-name> python=3.8`.
- Activate the virtual environment by running `conda activate <your-virtualenv_name>`
- Install Orchid by running `pip install orchid-python-api`.

## Configure the Orchid Python API

The Orchid Python API requires a licensed Orchid installation on your workstation. Depending on the details of
the installation, you may need to configure the Orchid Python API to refer to different locations.

### Using the fallback configuration

If you installed the latest version Orchid using the installation defaults, and you installed the 
`orchid-python-api` , you need to take **no** additional steps to configure the Orchid Python API to find this
installation. For your information, the default installation location is,
`%ProgramFiles%\Reveal Energy Services, Inc\Orchid`. The Orchid Python API uses its version to find and use
the corresponding version of Orchid.

### Using an environment variable

This mechanism is perhaps the easiest procedure to create an Orchid Python API configuration that changes 
rarely and is available to all your tools. It works best with a system restart. (Environment variables can be 
made available for a narrow set of tools on your system or available to all your tools depending on arcane
technical rules that you need not understand.) 

To use environment variables to configure the Orchid Python API, you will need to create the environment 
variable `ORCHID_ROOT` and set its value to the root Orchid installation directory. (For your information, the
version-specific Orchid binary files, `.exe`'s and `.dll`'s should be in a subdirectory of `ORCHID_ROOT` 
with a name like `Orchid-2020.4.232`.) 

This document assumes you want to create a long-term configuration that survives a system restart and is 
available to all your tools. Symbolically, this document will refer to the root of the Orchid installation as
`/path/to/orchid-installation`. 

To create the required environment variable, enter the search term "environment variables" in the Windows-10 
search box and select the item named, "Edit environment variables for your account." The system will then 
present your with the "Environment Variables" dialog. Under the section named "User variables for 
<your.username>", click the "New" button. In the "Variable name" text box, enter "ORCHID_ROOT". (These two 
words are separated by the underscore symbol.)

Navigate to the "Variable Value" text box. Click the "Browse Directory" button to select the directory into 
which Orchid is installed, `/path/to/orchid-installation`. This action pastes the directory name into the 
"Variable Value" text box. Verify that the directory is correct, and then click "OK". Verify that you see the 
name `ORCHID_ROOT` with the correct value in the "User variables for <your.username>" list. Finally, click 
"OK" to dismiss the "Environment Variables" dialog.

Although you have now created the `ORCHID_ROOT` environment variable with the appropriate value, only "new" 
tools can now use that variable. However, the details of "new" is technical and may not correspond to your 
what you expect. If you understand these details, you can jump to [Verify Installation](#verify-installation).
If you are not confident of these details, restart your system before proceeding to 
[Verify Installation](#verify-installation).

### Using a configuration file

Another option to configure the Orchid Python API is by creating a configuration file. A configuration file is
easier to change than an environment variable and does not require a system restart to work best. However, it
requires more knowledge and work on your part. In general, a configuration file is better if your requirements
change "often". For example, if you are working with multiple, side-by-side Orchid versions and Orchid Python 
API versions, you may find it faster and easier to create a configuration file once and change it as you 
change Orchid / Orchid Python API versions.

To create a configuration file used by the Orchid Python API, you create a file named `python_api.yaml`
and put it in the directory, `/path/to/home-directory/.orchid`, where `/path/to/home-directory` is a 
symbolic reference to your home directory. Technically, the format of the file is `YAML` ("YAML Ain't Markup
Language"), a "human friendly data serialization standard". (For technical details, visit 
[the website](https://yaml.org/). For a gentler introduction, visit 
[the Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) or read / watch on of the many `YAML` 
introductions / tutorials.)

Because these articles describe `YAML` generally, they **do not** describe the details of the `YAML` document
expected by the Orchid Python API. We, however, distribute an example file name `python_api.yaml.example` in 
each installed `orchid-python-api` package. Assuming you created a virtual environment as described in 
[Step-by step install](#step-by-step-install), you can find this example file, `python_api.yaml.example`, in
the directory, `/path/to/orchid-virtualenv/Lib/site-packages/orchid_python_api/examples`. 

To use this configuration file as an example:

- Copy the file to the expected location. For example, assuming the symbolic names referenced above, execute
  `copy /path/to/orchid-virtualenv/Lib/site-packages/orchid_python_api/examples/python_api.yaml.example
   /path/to/home-directory/.orchid/python_api.yaml`
- Edit the copied file, `/path/to/home-directory/.orchid/python_api.yaml`, using your favorite **text** editor.

The example file, contains comments, introduced by a leading octothorpe character (#, number sign, or hash), 
that describe the information expected by the Orchid Python API. In summary, you'll need to provide a value
for the 'orchid' > 'root' key that contains the pathname of the directory containing the Orchid binaries
corresponding to the installed version of the `orchid-python-api` package.

## Configure the Orchid training data

The Orchid Python API **requires** a licensed Orchid installation on your workstation. However, configuring
the Orchid Python API to find the Orchid training data is only needed to run the example Jupyter notebooks.

### Using an environment variable

This mechanism is perhaps the easiest procedure to create an Orchid Python API configuration that changes 
rarely and is available to all your tools. It works best with a system restart. (Environment variables can be 
made available for a narrow set of tools on your system or available to all your tools depending on arcane
technical rules that you need not understand.) 

To use environment variables to configure the Orchid Python API to find the Orchid training data, you will 
need to create the environment variable `ORCHID_TRAINING_DATA` and set its value to the location of the Orchid 
training data.

This document assumes you want to create a long-term configuration that survives a system restart and is 
available to all your tools. Symbolically, this document will refer to the Orchid training data location as
`/path-to/orchid/training-data`. 

To create the required environment variable, enter the search term "environment variables" in the Windows-10 
search box and select the item named, "Edit environment variables for your account." The system will then 
present your with the "Environment Variables" dialog. Under the section named "User variables for 
<your.username>", click the "New" button. In the "Variable name" text box, enter "ORCHID_TRAINING_DATA".
(These two words are separated by the underscore symbol.)

Navigate to the "Variable Value" text box. Click the "Browse Directory" button to select the directory 
containing the Orchid training data, `/path-to/orchid/training-data`. This action pastes the directory name
 into the "Variable Value" text box. Verify that the directory is correct, and then click "OK". Verify that you
see the name `ORCHID_TRAINING_DATA` with the correct value in the "User variables for <your.username>" list. 
Finally, click "OK" to dismiss the "Environment Variables" dialog.

Although you have now created the `ORCHID_ROOT` environment variable with the appropriate value, only "new"
tools can now use that variable. However, the details of "new" is technical and may not correspond to your 
what you expect. If you understand these details, you can jump to [Verify Installation](#verify-installation).
If you are not confident of these details, restart your system before proceeding to 
[Verify Installation](#verify-installation).

a system restart to work best. However, it requires more knowledge and work on your part. In general, a

# Verify installation

## Jupyter lab

- In your activated virtual environment, run `jupyter lab` to open a browser tab.
- In the first cell, enter `import orchid`.
- Run the cell.
- Wait patiently.

The import should complete with no errors.

## Python REPL

- In your activated virtual environment, run `python` to open a REPL.
- Enter `import orchid`.
- Wait patiently.

The import should complete with no errors.

# Run orchid examples

- Navigate to the directory associated with the virtual environment
- Run `python </path/to/virtualenv/Lib/site-packages/copy_orchid_examples.py`
- If the script reports that it skipped notebooks, repeat the command with an additional argument:  
  `python </path/to/virtualenv/Lib/site-packages/copy_orchid_examples.py --overwrite`
- Verify that the current directory has four notebooks:
    - `plot_trajectories.ipynb`
    - `plot_monitor_curves.ipynb`
    - `plot_treatment.ipynb`
    - `completion_analysis.ipynb`
- The notebooks, as installed, "symbolically" reference the Orchid training data. To resolve this "symbolic
  reference", 
  [configure the Orchid Python API to find the Orchid training data](#configure-the-orchid-training-data).
- Activate your virtual environment by `pipenv shell` if not already activated
- Open Jupyter by running `jupyter lab` in the shell
- Within Jupyter,
    Run the notebook, `plot_trajectories.ipynb`
        1. Open notebook
        2. Run all cells of notebook
        3. Wait patiently
        4. Verify that no exceptions occurred
    - Repeat for remaining notebooks:
        - `plot_monitor_curves.ipynb`
        - `plot_treatment.ipynb`
        - `completion_analysis.ipynb`

# View Orchid Configuration Details

To "debug" the Orchid Python API configuration, perform the following steps:

- Change to the directory associated with your Python virtual environment.
- If necessary, activate the virtual environment.
- Within that virtual environment, invoke Python. It is important to create a new REPL so that you start with 
  a "clean" environment.
- Within the Python REPL, execute the following commands.
  ```
  import logging
  logging.basicConfi(level=logging.DEBUG)
  import orchid
  ```
  
Enabling logging **before** importing is critical. If you have already imported `orchid`, the simplest solution 
is to close this REPL and create another, "clean" REPL.

You should see output like the following:

```
DEBUG:orchid.configuration:fallback configuration={'orchid': {'root': 'C:\\Program Files\\Reveal Energy Services, Inc\\Orchid\\Orchid-2020.4.361'}}
DEBUG:orchid.configuration:file configuration={'orchid': {'root': 'c:\\path-to\\bin\\x64\\Debug\\net48', 'training_data ': 'c:\\path-to\\installed-training-data'}}
DEBUG:orchid.configuration:environment configuration = {'orchid': {'root': 'c:\\another\\path-to\bin\\x64\\Debug\\net48'}}
DEBUG:orchid.configuration:result configuration={'orchid': {'root': 'c:\\another\\path-to\bin\\x64\\Debug\\net48'}}
```

This output describes four details of the configuration. 

| Configuration | Explanation |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| result | The configuration used by the Orchid Python API |
| fallback | The always available configuration |
| file | The configuration specified in your configuration file |
| environment | The configuration specified using environment variables | 

# The "numpy fmod" issue

Our release notes contain the known issues for a specific release. We wanted to emphasize one specific known
issue. Running the Orchid Python API example notebooks on Windows, the `numpy` package has presented an error
like the following

> RuntimeError: The current Numpy installation ('<filename of installed numpy>') fails to pass a sanity check
> due to a bug in the windows runtime. See this issue for more information: https://tinyurl.com/y3dm3h86s

Our work-around to this issue is to pin `numpy` to version 1.19.3 as recommended by Steven Wishnousky of
Microsoft in the thread mentioned in the error. We are continuing to await a fix from Microsoft for this issue.
