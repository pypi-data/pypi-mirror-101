Whoops... you just tried installing the wrong package.

Thankfully this placeholder package is in place to prevent a rouge actor
from running arbitrary code on your system.

Please review this misconfiguration in your deployment/development practices
as there may be other packages that could have this issue that havent been
protected yet.
