        Interact with JSON and YAML content through custom Python classes.
        How it works:
        - You specify the desired or expected format of your content using a [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) or 
          [OpenAPI Specification (version 3)](https://swagger.io/specification/).
        - Schema2type creates dynamic Python types for all the (sub-)schemas described by that schema/specification.
        - You can make use of these types from anywhere in your code to interact with the JSON or YAML content.
        - Schema2type also generates so-called [stub files](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/stubs.html), 
          which allow you to make use of your IDE's auto-complete functionality for the dynamically created types 
          (this is arguably the most convenient feature of this module and works with both PyCharm and VS Code).
        
        
        JSON/YAML content can be read from a file, but it can also be content obtained through any other means, such as through
        an HTTP request.
        
        ## Example
        If you frequently interact with OpenAPI Specifications, you might want make use of dynamic classes based on the 
        [JSON schema that describes the format of an OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/schemas/v3.0/schema.yaml)
        (indeed, "a specification of a specification document" is rather meta, but very useful in this case).
        
        ```python
        import prance
        from my_schema_classes.openapi import RootObject as OpenAPISpecification
        
        # resolve references in the specification with the prance module
        resolved_specification = prance.ResolvingParser('/path/to/pet_store_openapi_spec.yml').specification
        
        # create a schema-based object from the YAML content
        specification_object = OpenAPISpecification(**resolved_specification)
        
        # access information from the specification with auto-complete to guide you along the way:
        print(specification_object.info.title)                       # > Swagger Petstore - OpenAPI 3.0
        print(type(specification_object.components))                 # > <class 'schema2type.Components'>
        pet_schema = specification_object.components.schemas['Pet']
        print(type(pet_schema))                                      # > <class 'schema2type.Schema'>
        print(pet_schema.required)                                   # > ['name', 'photoUrls']
        
        ```
        
        ## Compatibility
        At the time of  writing, schema2type has been tested with schemas specified in the following formats/documents:
        - [OpenAPI Specification Version 3.0](https://swagger.io/specification/)
        - [JSON Schema Draft 4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-04)
        
        
        ## Disclaimer
        This module is currently in development. At the moment, it can handle most, but not all situations when it comes to 
        parsing your JSON schema or OpenAPI specification. Use at your own risk of running into any potential errors. Support
        for `oneOf`, `allOf`, and `anyOf` schemas is still limited.
        
        ## How to install
        Schema2type is available from PyPI, and can be installed via pip:
        ```bash
        pip install schema2type
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        First, generate the stub files based on your schema or specification:
        ```bash
        mkdir "/path/to/my_package/my_module/schema_classes"
        schema2type gen-stubs --out "/path/to/my_package/my_module/schema_classes" --name "my_schema_name" "/path/to/my_package/a_schema.yml" json_schema
        ```
        Then, import the schema based classes from within your module wherever you need them:
        ```python
        from my_package.schema_classes.my_schema import *
        ```
